LoFtool provides a rank of genic intolerance and consequent
susceptibility to disease based on the ratio of Loss-of-function (LoF)
to synonymous mutations for each gene in 60,706 individuals from ExAC,
adjusting for the gene de novo mutation rate and evolutionary protein
conservation. The lower the LoFtool gene score percentile the most
intolerant is the gene to functional variation. For more details please see
(Fadista J et al. 2017), PMID:27563026.
The authors would like to thank the Exome Aggregation Consortium and
the groups that provided exome variant data for comparison. A full
list of contributing groups can be found at http://exac.broadinstitute.org/about.

The LoFtool_scores.txt file is found alongside the plugin in the
VEP_plugins GitHub repo.
